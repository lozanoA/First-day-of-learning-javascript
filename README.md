# Introduction and goals


This will be like a recap of each session of learning. 
I have tried to learn Python before but my problem is that I get bored and don't really fully commit no matter how boring it is. With this new endeavor the main reason is to -
fully translate ideas that come into my mind of random things and put it into a piece of code.
Like I said before I want to fully commit this time and try to learn code.
I think my final goal is to be able to make pieces of code with the intent of fullying an idea that came to my head.
