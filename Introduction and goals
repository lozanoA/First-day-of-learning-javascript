This will be like a recap of each seasion of learning. 
I have tried to learn python before but my problem is that I get bored and don't really fully commit no matter how boring it is. Wit this new endevor the main reason is to -
fully transalate ideas that comes into my mind of random things and put it into a piece of code.
Like I said before I want to fully commit this time and try to learn code.
I think my final goal is to be able to make pieces of code with the intent of fullying a idea that came to my head.
